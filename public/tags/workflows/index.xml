      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to use OpenClaw to automate some of the tasks I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is great for acting as a research assistant and I configured it to do the research for some of the tasks I have in my Todoist. Whenever I think of capturing a task, I do it in Todoist and get to it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To automate research tasks like comparing headphones, or summarizing a the comment thread of a HackerNews post, I asked the bot to create a cron job every 4 hours and do the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now every 6 hours it checks Todoist and looks for tasks with the label &lt;code&gt;ellie&lt;/code&gt; (the name of my bot) and picks up the task. It does all the research and puts what it finds in a markdown file in a specific directory. It also adds additional metadata, if any, at the end of the file. Once it does all that, it notifies me on Discord with a brief summary of what it did.&lt;/p&gt;
