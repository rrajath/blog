Iâ€™m a programmer currently living in Seattle, Washington. I came to the United States in 2012 to do my Masters in Computer Science. I graduated in May 2014 from University of Illinois at Chicago.

I was born and brought up in Bangalore, India. I like running, I've done few half marathons and couple of full marathons. I also read lot of non-fiction books and listen to podcasts all the time. I've been playing lot of Chess recently.

I use this blog to write about my experiences while learning new things. Hope you find something useful here.
