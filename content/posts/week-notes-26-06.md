Last week I was quite busy with work, but I did play around with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.io) a bit more.


## Explorations {#explorations}

I installed [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on all my devices. I'll be writing a blog post about it soon. The setup was way easier than I thought it would be.

I augmented my [Todoist](https://todoist.com) grocery helper workflow on OpenClaw to make it check for deals/coupons on QFC as it adds each item to my Todoist.

OpenClaw by default uses Raspberry Pi as its coding agent and when I asked it to build a couple of web apps, it did an okay job. I had to prompt it a bunch of times to fix some minor UI bugs and it really struggled with it. So, I used [claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) to rewrite one of the web apps and make enhancements (and fix bugs) in the other web app. I also made sure to use the frontend-design plugin to get a polished and professional looking UI. It did an awesome job and I was really happy with the result.


## Projects {#projects}

Worked on an Android app that I'm calling Bloggo which is to write markdown files from the phone and push it to GitHub. This is mainly to blog on the go and not have to depend on a laptop and run git commands in order to post something to Hugo (or a similar static site generator). I'll be writing a more detailed blog post about this soon.


## Misc {#misc}

I didn't get much reading done. I was kinda caught up with perfecting my set up with OpenClaw and Tailscale.
