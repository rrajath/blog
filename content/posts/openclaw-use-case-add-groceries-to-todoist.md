I use Todoist as my shopping list for groceries. I have a Shopping List project in my Todoist where items can have labels like `wholefoods`, `costco`, etc. My workflow to add items to the Shopping List project was to open the Todoist's Add Task shortcut on my Pixel, type the item, optionally add a label, then add the item to the Shopping List project. If I had to add multiple items, I had to do this for each item. Optionally I could open Todoist, go to the project and then add it there. But still there was good amount of friction. What I really wanted was to just add stuff and have it go to the right place. 

Since I had already linked my Todoist account to OpenClaw, I asked it to add groceries to the Shopping List project. And I don't have to add items individually, I don't have to move them to a specific project. All I have to do is, open the chat (Discord) and say something like "add eggs, milk and bread". That's it. OpenClaw adds them as separate items in the Shopping List project. I can optionally mention "add the label costco" to add that label to all items. Or to specific items. Because it's LLM, I can use natural language and it would understand what I mean and do the task. 

This has improved my workflow a lot. The fact that I can add either one or multiple items without giving it any more context and have it appear on my Todoist is great!
