It was quite an interesting and productive week. Here are some of the things I did:

## Projects
I vibe-coded an Android app called [[https://github.com/rrajath/expander/][Expander]]. It's a text expansion app that works for both static and dynamic snippets (like date, time, day, with custom formats). 

I also vibe-coded an emacs package called [[https://github.com/rrajath/org-retro-journal][org-retro-journal.el]] which is like Memories in Google Photos but for journaling. You can look back at what you did that exact day or the nearest date each year across your journal. 

## Explorations
I installed [[https://openclaw.ai/][OpenClaw]] on my Raspberry Pi and created some automations. It acts as a research assistant where it scans my todoist tasks every few hours and does the research, outputting the analysis to a markdown file and letting me know on discord that it completed the task (along with a short summary of what it did)
