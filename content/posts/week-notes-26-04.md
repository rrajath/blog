Here's everything I did last week


## Fediverse stuff {#fediverse-stuff}

I stumbled upon [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/) and found it really interesting. After a few minutes of checking out the services that were offered, I joined and created a [profile page](https://rrajath.omg.lol/), a [now page](https://rrajath.omg.lol/now) and a [weblog](https://rrajath.weblog.lol/). I also joined [social.lol](https://social.lol/home) and it has some of the nicest people there. I'm really digging this whole ecosystem.


## Domain registrar switch {#domain-registrar-switch}

Realized I was paying a little too much for my domain at [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). And they kept increasing their prices. Found out about [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) and saw some good reviews by the fine folks at social.lol and ended up switching. The whole migration took about 15 minutes and it was really smooth.


## Blog posts I wrote {#blog-posts-i-wrote}

-   [App Defaults - 2025 Edition](https://rrajath.com/posts/app-defaults-2025/)


## Projects {#projects}

Made an enhancement to [my blog](https://rrajath.com/) hosted on GitHub pages. The search box was huge and had a white background. It was looking ugly when the blog had a dark theme. With the help of LLM, I updated the CSS so that the search box blends with the blog theme and it now looks much nicer.
