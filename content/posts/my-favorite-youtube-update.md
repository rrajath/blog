A few days ago I visited YouTube and saw this:

For many years, I turned off my YouTube watch history to avoid getting distracted by the recommendations that appeared on my homepage. As a result, my homepage was quite boring and contained only a few videos from my subscriptions and a few popular videos in general. Nothing was personalized. Although I still found myself clicking on a few of those videos every now and then, it had drastically reduced from when I had the watch history turned on.

Recently, YouTube updated its platform and now forces me to turn on the watch history in order to show any video recommendations at all. Surprisingly, this is my favorite update yet. Now when I visit YouTube, it's always a blank screen and I can never get distracted or go down YouTube rabbit holes.
