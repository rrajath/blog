It's been quite a while since I last updated my blog. I was busy with exams and then vacations. I went back home (Bangalore, India) after about 1.5 years to enjoy a warm winter break as I was missing the terrible polar vortex that hit Chicago for couple of weeks in December. I couldn't get to work on any of my hobby projects since I had to spend time with family and friends. The one month went by really fast and before I knew it I was back walking on the freezing streets of Chicago again. I got busy with doing literature survey for my Masters Project and had to read lot of papers to deeply understand the problem statement. The project is about developing a Car Navigation System inside a parking lot. I will be talking more about the project in my next Weekly Noise post. But for now, it's glad to be back :)
