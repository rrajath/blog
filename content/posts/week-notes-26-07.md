Last week I was contemplating more and more about how I can reduce my phone usage. I noticed I was on my phone quite a lot and needed a break. I was mostly browsing Reddit, HackerNews and Lobsters. I needed a way to reduce this usage and be still, where I don't feel the need to reach for my phone. It's still a work in progress. I need to get back into reading, I've taken quite a long break from it. 

I've been listening to a lot of [Goose](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5tkITWzssc9z9hu7ZEOCXz?si=Z1bspdd9RrO-0F0EBHUtVA) and [their](https://youtu.be/ZjfBeKfZlRg) [live](https://youtu.be/MiP9OmMHOK0) [shows](https://youtu.be/YmV1TF4y2BE). I'm obsessed. 

Also, I baked a cake for my wife for Valentine's Day.
