title: 'Weekly Noise #2 - Theme Enhancements'
---
Last week I worked on the theme to modify few things which I have explained in the [My Theme Setup](/my-theme-setup/) post. I added a Projects link in the Navbar at the top which I will be filling up with my hobby projects sometime soon. I was held up with a class project in one of the courses which ate up most of my time. But I did finish what I had planned to finish. I've also got my finals approaching in less than a month so my updates may not be significant. That being said, here are some tasks for next week:

- Integrate Medium-style "time it takes to read the post" (I don't know what it's called) feature into posts.
- Write about one of my hobby projects.
- Buy a domain and make it point to my GitHub page.
