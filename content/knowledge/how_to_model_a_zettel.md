## How to model index card in my zettelkasten {#how-to-model-index-card-in-my-zettelkasten}

-   each index card (or note) must have one idea. It shouldn't be a catch all for a subject like astrophysics. If you want to [make connections between ideas]({{< relref "how_to_take_smart_notes" >}}), make them as small and atomic as possible
-   each idea must be condensed to fit in an index card. If you explain too much, you don't understand it well enough
-   each note must end with questions. Think about how kids ask "why" endlessly. You can't just consume information and be like, "okay, that makes sense. Moving on". There must be open questions. This will encourage you to research other topics and make more connections
-   each note must have links. If it's a brand new idea that doesn't relate to anything you've ever read, it should still contain tags and links to sources.
