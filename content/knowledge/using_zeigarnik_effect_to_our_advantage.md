[Zeigarnik Effect]({{< relref "zeigarnik_effect" >}}) can be used to our advantage by taking notes. When a less important task comes up and interrupts us, we can just write it down somewhere and continue working on our tasks. The claim in [Book: How to take Smart Notes]({{< relref "book_how_to_take_smart_notes" >}}) is that the brain cannot distinguish between a finished task and the one that's postponed.
So, we can apply the reverse by leaving open questions to linger in our mind so that our brains will solve them creatively during a walk or a shower, and taking notes of the rest.


## Questions {#questions}

-   [Question]({{< relref "question" >}}): Check if this really works. This may take some shift in thinking where it must be consciously applied.
